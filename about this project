Messenger application

// Creating account
we have one server and client app
server will be running always
if I run client app on my laptop server should ask my account is available or not
if not it will ask my email address for creating an account
then server sends one-time random number to my email for confirmation

// inside the app
after creations account client app show me menu

at a showing time if we enter a nickname of user(we already establish connection) or group(we joined),
then we start chatting there
when you disconnect this client app all messages which have seen in groups and chats will be removed
after exactly that time if someone send me a message it will be saved in server and if I come back again,
server will send them yo me
the same in groups

when we are in some kind of groups or chat we have a command /quit
then we will back to out menu

menu:
1 - search for people to talk to
here we should search their nickname, server checks if nickname is available
if yes, we can establish connection with that user
if no, return there is no such user
after connection we can send and get messages, pictures, files (and even I want to send small videos)
if this user is available in server but not online at this time server should save all what I send
and send to this account when it is online
for disconnect this connection we have a command /remove user

2 - search for groups
also group nickname should be searched
if available, ask from user if he want to join or not
if not search another group until user enter a command about stop search ( /quit )
after joining,
we can see all messages in this group starting from that time when user joined
